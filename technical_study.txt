is emc data domain technology a SAN?

No, EMC Data Domain technology is not a Storage Area Network (SAN). It is a data deduplication solution primarily designed for backup and archiving purposes.

Here’s how EMC Data Domain differs from a SAN:

Data Deduplication: EMC Data Domain provides storage that uses deduplication technology, which reduces the amount of storage required by eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data. This technology helps in making backup and archiving processes more efficient by reducing the storage footprint.

Backup and Archiving: EMC Data Domain is primarily used in backup and disaster recovery scenarios. It integrates with backup software to provide efficient data storage by optimizing how data is stored, particularly in environments where large volumes of backup data are generated.

What is a SAN?
A Storage Area Network (SAN), on the other hand, is a high-speed network of storage devices (like disk arrays and tape libraries) that are connected to servers. It provides block-level access to storage, typically allowing multiple servers to access the same storage resources in a centralized manner. SANs are used for high-performance, enterprise-level storage solutions.

Key Differences:
EMC Data Domain focuses on data deduplication and storage optimization for backup and archiving.
A SAN is an infrastructure solution for block-level storage access.
So, while EMC Data Domain can be used as part of a broader storage strategy that includes SANs, it is not a SAN itself. Instead, it works with storage solutions (including SANs) to provide backup and data protection with deduplication.

EMC Data Domain is a hardware appliance that comes with deduplication software integrated into it. It is not just software that can be installed on existing hardware; it is a purpose-built hardware appliance designed for efficient backup, archiving, and data deduplication.

Key Points:
Hardware Appliance: EMC Data Domain is delivered as a physical appliance that includes both the hardware and the software needed to perform data deduplication and storage management.

Software Integration: The appliance includes Data Domain Operating System (DDOS), which is the software that handles data deduplication, backup, archiving, and other storage management features.

Models and Configurations: EMC offers various models of Data Domain appliances, ranging from entry-level appliances to high-end, enterprise-class systems. These models come with different storage capacities, performance characteristics, and scalability options to meet various needs.

Virtual Options: In addition to physical appliances, EMC also offers Data Domain Virtual Edition (DDVE), which allows organizations to run Data Domain's deduplication software on virtual machines. This provides more flexibility, particularly for smaller environments or cloud-based deployments.

Conclusion:
EMC Data Domain is primarily a hardware appliance with integrated software for data protection and deduplication, though there are also virtualized versions for specific use cases. It is not just software that can be installed on any hardware.

To integrate EMC Data Domain into your network and back up data from your 10 Windows VMs and 15 Linux VMs, you would follow a multi-step process to ensure that the Data Domain appliance can efficiently handle your backup and archiving needs. Below is an overview of how to do this:

Step 1: Deploy the EMC Data Domain Appliance
Choose Deployment Type:

If you are using a physical Data Domain appliance, it needs to be physically installed and connected to your network. It can be connected to your environment via Ethernet (iSCSI, NFS, or CIFS) or Fibre Channel (for SAN environments).
If you are using Data Domain Virtual Edition (DDVE), you would deploy the software on a virtual machine (VM), either on-premises or in a cloud environment, with sufficient CPU, memory, and storage resources.
Network Configuration:

Ensure the Data Domain appliance or VM is connected to your network in such a way that all the VMs (both Windows and Linux) can communicate with it. Typically, Data Domain is connected via iSCSI, NFS, or CIFS protocols over a TCP/IP network.
Data Domain Management:

Use the Data Domain System Manager (a web-based interface) to configure the Data Domain appliance. This will allow you to configure storage pools, deduplication settings, and other management functions.
Step 2: Set Up Backup on Windows and Linux VMs
Backup Software:

You’ll need a backup software solution (such as Veritas NetBackup, Veeam, Commvault, or Dell EMC Avamar) to integrate with your VMs. Many of these solutions have built-in support for Data Domain.
Install the backup software agents on your Windows and Linux VMs to manage the backup process.
Backup Target Configuration:

In your backup software, configure the backup target to be the Data Domain appliance. You will specify the Data Domain storage as the destination for your backup data.
For Windows, you can use CIFS or NFS protocols to mount Data Domain storage as a backup target.
For Linux, you can configure it to use NFS or iSCSI for backup data storage.
Backup Process:

Once the target is configured, you can schedule and run the backup tasks for your VMs. Your backup software will then interact with the Data Domain appliance to store the backup data.
Step 3: Data Storage on EMC Data Domain
Deduplication: Data Domain uses deduplication technology to minimize the storage footprint. It eliminates duplicate copies of the data and stores only unique data chunks. This significantly reduces the amount of physical storage needed on the Data Domain appliance.

Where Will It Store Data?

The backup data from your VMs will be stored on the Data Domain appliance's internal storage. The storage is typically organized into Storage Pools and Data Invocations within the Data Domain appliance.
When backups are initiated, they will be directed to one or more virtual volumes or data repositories configured on the Data Domain system. These volumes will house the deduplicated backup data.
Step 4: Data Access and Management
Data Availability: The backup data will reside on the Data Domain appliance. You can access it via the management interface to restore data or perform maintenance tasks, like replication or archiving to offsite locations.

Replication: Optionally, you can configure replication on Data Domain to replicate your backup data to a remote Data Domain appliance (for disaster recovery purposes).

Summary
Deploy EMC Data Domain (physical appliance or virtual edition) and connect it to your network.
Install backup software on your Windows and Linux VMs and configure them to use Data Domain as the backup target.
The backup data from your Windows and Linux VMs will be stored in the Data Domain appliance using deduplication to minimize storage consumption.
Use Data Domain System Manager to monitor, manage, and optionally replicate the backup data to other locations for added security.
By following these steps, you can efficiently use EMC Data Domain for backing up your 10 Windows VMs and 15 Linux VMs.
